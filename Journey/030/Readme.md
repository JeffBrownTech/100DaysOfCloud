# Week 1

## Introduction

I'm starting the [CloudSkills.io Cloud Native DevOps Bootcamp](https://cloudskills.io/courses/cloud-native). I've been a CloudSkills.io member for quite a while and have enjoyed the expertise Mike Pfeiffer and other instructions have produced. I'm looking forward to getting started with this bootcamp. It is going to cover learning AWS and Azure by completing 46 projects.

## Prerequisite

- CloudSkills.io subscription
- Azure and AWS accounts

## What I Learned this Week

The bootcamp has a live lecture each week. The first week, Michael Levan covered the basics of devops, and Mike Pfeiffer talked more about what it takes to be successful.

There were 5 projects to complete this week:

- Create a GitHub account
- Create an Azure account
- Create an AWS account
- GitHub projects
- GitHub Actions

I already had accounts in those 3 different services, so that was quick work. I didn't know GitHub had project tracking, so that was a nice-to-see feature. Finally, while I have heard of GitHub Actions, I never worked with them before. Michael L. walked through creating the default "Hello, World" project. GitHub Actions are written in YAML.

I can see why people think this might end up being a replacement for Azure DevOps. With Projects in there two, this has a lot of the same functionality.

## Next Steps

Week 2 will cover Scripting Like a Developer.
