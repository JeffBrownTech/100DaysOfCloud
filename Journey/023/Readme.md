# Managing Runbook Authentication and Modules

## Introduction

Azure Automation is a tool for automation and configuration of Azure resources. You can author runbooks in PowerShell or Python to manage and interact with your Azure tenant. In this third day, I'm covering hybrid worker groups. These allow executing runbooks outside the Azure sandbox environment.

## Prerequisite

- Azure Subscription
- Some PowerShell knowledge
- Azure VM or on-premises server to act as a hybrid worker

## Try yourself

Check out the full steps over at the CloudSkill.io blog where I outline how to get started:

## Next Steps

Following up from this, I need to find an automation project to implement.
