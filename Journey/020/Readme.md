## Introduction

I complete my Azure Function study by deploying a project around retrieving Microsoft Teams PSTN Usage records and storing them into table storage.

## Use Case

Teams PSTN Usage Records are stored in the Teams service and can be retrieved using Graph API. Storing them into table storage allows importing into other services, like Power BI for analysis.

## Try yourself

This project requires knowledge of multiple technologies including Azure app registrations, PowerShell, Graph API, Azure Key Vault, Microsoft Teams, and Azure Functions.

I blogged about the full solution over at blog [jeffbrown.tech](https://jeffbrown.tech).

## Next Steps

I move onto learning about Azure Automation.
